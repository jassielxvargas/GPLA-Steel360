        <h2>Connection Design Team</h2>

        <p>
          As you may recall, I previously mentioned that I work closely with a small detailing team based in the Dominican Republic. The team is not owned by me, but it operates fully under my direction and works exclusively in support of my projects. Today, the team consists of four members, three of whom have been working with me for nearly three years. If needed, we could scale the group to approximately seven people fairly quickly. As you can see in the picture below, each station has (2) 32" monitors to allow for better visualization of the drawings and the model. Below is a picture of their office.
        </p>

        <div class="office-photo">

            loading="lazy"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          Two members of the team are civil engineers, and over time, they have begun assisting with connection design. If you press the button below, you will see a sample of a job they just finished. They are not yet at the level we ultimately need; however, with focused training over the next one to three months, I believe they can reach the required level of proficiency.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Operating Concept</h3>

        <p>
          We would receive the project contract drawings showing end reactions, along with a “rough” structural model, essentially LOD 300 with columns and beams only and no connections. The Dominican Republic team would perform the labor-intensive portion of the connection modeling and preliminary design work. Then, depending on workload, one or two senior engineers in the United States would review, finalize, and stamp the calculations as required.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Connections are added directly into the model, reducing back-and-forth clarification and RFIs.</li>
          <li>Turnaround time improves because modeling and engineering progress in parallel rather than sequentially.</li>
          <li>Licensed engineers can focus on review, coordination, and decision-making instead of production tasks.</li>
          <li>We gain meaningful cost efficiency while maintaining direct control over quality, standards, and priorities.</li>
          <li>The team develops long-term familiarity with our preferences and becomes an extension of our organization.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For context, current labor rates for this team range between $16 and $19 per hour, not including software licensing such as SDS/2 and RAM Connection, which my current employer already provides. I would be interested to understand how this compares to the rates for the existing team in India.
        </p>

        <p>
          Initially, we would rely on commercial software to design the connections. However, within a few months, I believe we can begin transitioning toward internally developed tools that will improve consistency, transparency, and confidence in the results. I have the technical capability to support the development of this software.

        <h2>Steel360 for Delivery of Project Information to Fabricators and/or Erectors</h2>

        <p>
          As I have mentioned, I have been working on a web app, named Steel360, which allows us to deliver project information to our clients in a simple, organized way. Through a secure portal, clients can access:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Contract drawings</li>
          <li>3D model</li>
          <li>2D shop and erection drawings</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Our clients will be able to navigate and explore the drawings and model in a straightforward way. This helps clients understand the work visually, reduces confusion, and supports better coordination conversations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Steel360 also centralizes documents, maintains version control, and keeps everything in one place instead of being spread across emails and shared drives. Project information is portable and can be accessed from anywhere via a computer or iPad, since all content is stored in the cloud.
        </p>

        <p>
          This capability is an added-value project tool that we can include when appropriate and when it aligns with the scope and commercial terms of the project, not as a generic free service, but as part of a coordinated delivery approach. Below are three short video clips to give you a clearer idea of how our clients might use it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The short clips below illustrate how a client experiences each view inside Steel360.
