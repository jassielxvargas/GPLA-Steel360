      <h2>Connection Design Team</h2>

      <p>
        As you may recall, I work closely with a small detailing team based in the Dominican Republic. The team is not
        owned by me, but it operates fully under my direction and works exclusively in support of my projects. Today,
        the team consists of four members, three of whom have been working with me for nearly three years. If needed,
        we can scale the group to approximately seven people fairly quickly. The photo below shows the office.
      </p>

      <div class="office-photo">
        <img src="L3P Office.jpeg" alt="L3P office in the Dominican Republic" />
      </div>

      <p>
        Two members of the team are civil engineers and, over time, they have begun assisting with connection design.
        Attached in the original document is a sample of a job they recently completed. They are not yet at the level
        we ultimately need; however, with focused training over the next one to three months, I believe they can reach
        the required level of proficiency.
      </p>

      <h3>Operating Concept</h3>

      <p>
        We would receive the project contract drawings showing end reactions, along with a “rough” structural model—
        essentially LOD 300 with columns and beams only and no connections. The Dominican Republic team would perform
        the labor-intensive portion of the connection modeling and preliminary design work. Then, depending on
        workload, one or two senior engineers in the United States would review, finalize, and stamp the calculations
        as required.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Advantages</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Connections are added directly into the model, reducing back-and-forth clarification and RFIs.</li>
        <li>Turnaround time improves because modeling and engineering progress in parallel rather than sequentially.</li>
        <li>Licensed engineers can focus on review, coordination, and decision-making instead of production tasks.</li>
        <li>We gain meaningful cost efficiency while maintaining direct control over quality, standards, and priorities.</li>
        <li>The team develops long-term familiarity with our preferences and becomes an extension of our organization.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Client Information Delivery Using Steel360</h2>

      <p>
        Steel360 allows us to deliver project information to our clients in a simple, organized way. Through a secure
        portal, clients can access:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Contract drawings</li>
        <li>Shop and erection drawings</li>
        <li>A 3D model they can move, rotate, and explore on a computer or iPad</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This helps clients understand the work visually, reduces confusion, and supports better coordination
        conversations. Steel360 also centralizes documents, maintains version control, and keeps everything in one
        place instead of being spread across emails and shared drives.
      </p>

      <p>
        The short clips below illustrate how a client experiences each view inside Steel360.
